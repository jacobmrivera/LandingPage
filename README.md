# LandingPage
Landing Page project for The Odin Project

Following project guidelines for The Odin Project, this webpage is to demonstrate my ability to put and arrange objects (mostly flex objects) on a webpage. While more could have been done to populate the page with images, I did not want to worry about copyright necessities, so I have left blanks where images would go, and placeholder text where descriptions would go.
